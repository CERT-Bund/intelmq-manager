# IntelMQ Control Platform

IntelMQ Control Platform is a graphical interface to manage configurations for IntelMQ framework.

### Pipeline

You will be able to see the pipeline in a graph-like visualization like this:

### Configuration Files

With the information you add graphically the interface will generate the configurations you have to put into your IntelMQ instance to behave like you visually configured it.
The configurations are shown in different tabs which you can simply copy-paste to the appropriate files on the server.
