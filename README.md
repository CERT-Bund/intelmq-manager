**ALMOST COMPATIBLE WITH INTELMQ**

# IntelMQ Helper

Graphical interface to manage configurations for IntelMQ.


This interface lets you visually configure the whole IntelMQ pipeline and the parameters of every single bot.
You will be able to see the pipeline in a graph-like visualization like this:

When you add a node or edit one you'll be presented with a form with the bots available parameters and can easily change the values like this:

![Parameter editing](screenshot2.png?raw=true "Parameter editing")

With the information you add graphically the interface will generate the configurations you have to put into your IntelMQ instance to behave like you visually configured it.
The configurations are shown in different tabs which you can simply copy-paste to the appropriate files on the server.
